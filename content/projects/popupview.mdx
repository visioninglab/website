PopupView is Visioning Lab's core AR platform for phones and tablets. Users point their camera at an image or QR code to trigger a 3D animation with sound. Developed primarily with artists, architects, writers and musicians, the platform hosts multiple campaigns in one shared app, enabling cultural partners to commission animated works that appear from posters, books, or objects in public space.

## Platform approach

Rather than creating individual apps for each project, PopupView provides a single platform where multiple AR campaigns coexist, making it easier for cultural organisations to commission AR work.

## Creative applications

The platform has been used for exhibitions, public art, heritage interpretation, festivals and publishing — anywhere a trigger image can prompt a digital response.

## Accessible AR

By using image recognition rather than requiring markers or complex setup, PopupView makes AR accessible to audiences who may never have used immersive technology before.
