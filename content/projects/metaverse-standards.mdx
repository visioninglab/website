Visioning Lab contributes to international efforts to develop standards for immersive and spatial computing environments.

## Context

As immersive technology moves from gaming and entertainment into infrastructure, education, and public services, the need for interoperability standards becomes critical. Without shared standards, immersive environments become silos — valuable individually, but unable to connect or scale.

## Our Contribution

We participate in standards bodies and working groups focused on:

- Spatial data representation in immersive environments
- Interoperability between immersive platforms
- Accessibility standards for spatial computing
- Ethical frameworks for immersive experiences in public contexts

## Why It Matters

Standards shape markets. By contributing early, we help ensure that immersive technology standards reflect the needs of research, education, and public interest — not just commercial applications.
