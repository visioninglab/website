For Lightwaves Festival, Visioning Lab worked with The Lowry and artist Amber Sanchez to create AR experiences inspired by L.S. Lowry. Visitors produced contemporary 3D drawings in VR; these appeared through the PopupView app when viewing montage artworks based on their work.

## Collaborative creation

Visitors drew in VR, creating contemporary responses to Lowry's industrial landscapes. Their drawings were compiled into montage artworks displayed at the festival.

## Layered experience

Scanning the montage artworks with AR triggered the individual VR drawings to appear in 3D, revealing the creative contributions hidden within the composite image.

## Public creativity

The project demonstrated how immersive technology can support participatory art-making, with the public as co-creators rather than passive viewers.
