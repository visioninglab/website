A themed virtual collaboration space created with Joe Ravetz. Designed around the elements (earth, air, fire, water), it hosted workshops and meetings for over five years before being redeveloped in FrameVR.

## The concept

The Collaboratarium was more than a meeting space — it was a designed environment where the architecture itself reflected themes of collaboration, natural systems and transformation.

## Use

For five years, it served as a meeting ground for research teams, hosting discussions on infrastructure futures, systems thinking and collaborative planning.

## Evolution

The project has since been redeveloped in FrameVR, maintaining the core concept while adapting to new platform capabilities.
