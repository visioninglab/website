Working with musician-artist Pete Moser, Visioning Lab created AR postcards revealing hidden histories of Speke Hall and its links to the slave trade. Scanning the postcards triggered music and visual content responding to the site's past.

## Difficult histories

Speke Hall, like many historic houses, has connections to the transatlantic slave trade that are not immediately visible in its architecture or standard interpretation.

## Creative response

Pete Moser created musical responses to these histories, which were triggered through AR postcards, allowing visitors to engage with uncomfortable truths through art.

## Heritage and responsibility

The project demonstrated how AR can support nuanced heritage interpretation, creating space for reflection on difficult histories.
