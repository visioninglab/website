A walking trail highlighting influential Victorian women in Manchester. Delivered via the Echoes app and installed in Manchester Central Library.

## Missing voices

Victorian Manchester is often remembered through the stories of industrialists and reformers, but the contributions of women to the city's social, cultural and political life have been less visible in public history.

## The trail

Visitors walked through the city centre, discovering stories of suffragists, educators, writers and activists who shaped Manchester's character.

## Permanent installation

The trail was installed permanently at Manchester Central Library, ensuring long-term access to these histories.
