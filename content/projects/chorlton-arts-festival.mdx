During COVID-19, Visioning Lab built a virtual festival field hosting performances, screenings and events. Musicians filmed performances that appeared on screens within the shared virtual environment.

## Context

When physical festivals became impossible during the pandemic, Chorlton Arts Festival needed a way to maintain community connection and celebrate local creativity.

## The environment

A virtual festival field with stages, screening areas and gathering spaces where visitors could watch performances together in real-time while maintaining physical distance.

## Impact

The festival demonstrated that virtual spaces could host meaningful cultural experiences, creating a sense of togetherness during isolation.
