Ontology Maker is a tool that uses AI to help domain experts create, refine, and validate formal ontologies for infrastructure systems.

## The Challenge

Building ontologies traditionally requires deep expertise in both the domain and in knowledge representation. This creates a bottleneck — the people who understand infrastructure best are rarely the ones who build the data models that describe it.

## Our Approach

Ontology Maker bridges this gap by using large language models to:

- Extract concepts and relationships from domain documents
- Suggest ontological structures based on established standards
- Validate proposed ontologies against real-world data
- Generate human-readable documentation alongside machine-readable formats

## Impact

The tool is being developed in collaboration with infrastructure organisations to ensure that the ontologies it generates are practical, standards-compliant, and decision-relevant.
