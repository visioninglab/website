A combined AR and audio trail exploring the Chartist uprising in Manchester. Visitors followed locations across the city and triggered stories via a historic map and location-based audio.

## Heritage context

The Chartist movement in Manchester represents a crucial moment in working-class political history, but its physical traces have largely disappeared from the cityscape.

## The trail

Visitors used a historic map as an AR trigger to reveal visual content, while location-based audio told stories of the uprising as they walked through the relevant sites.

## Layering history

The project demonstrated how AR can make invisible histories visible, overlaying contemporary spaces with their radical past.
