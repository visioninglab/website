With sculptor Prof. Keith Brown, Visioning Lab produced a virtual reality environment allowing visitors to move inside his 3D sculptures. An associated AR version enabled a sculpture to appear in 3D from a 2D image trigger.

## Sculptural space

Keith Brown's sculptures create complex spatial relationships. VR allowed visitors to inhabit that space from the inside, experiencing the work in ways impossible with physical sculpture.

## Dual experience

The VR environment provided immersive exploration, while AR allowed the sculpture to appear in any location when triggered by an image, making the work portable and accessible.

## Art and technology

The project explored how immersive technology can extend sculptural practice, creating new relationships between viewer and artwork.
