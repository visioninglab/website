An AR postcard series where images of birds triggered animated 3D birds and their songs. Designed to help audiences connect visual identification with birdsong.

## Educational concept

Birdwatching guides teach visual identification, and audio guides teach birdsong, but rarely are the two combined in a way that reinforces the connection between appearance and sound.

## The experience

Scanning a postcard with an image of a bird triggered a 3D animated version of that bird along with its authentic song, creating a multisensory learning experience.

## Learning through AR

The project demonstrated how AR can combine visual and audio learning in ways that printed guides cannot, helping people develop richer sensory recognition skills.
