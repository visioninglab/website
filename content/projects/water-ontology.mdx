This project develops a comprehensive ontology for water and wastewater infrastructure that centres decision-making rather than asset inventory.

## Background

Water utilities manage vast, aging networks with limited budgets. The data systems they use — often inherited from decades-old asset management platforms — struggle to support the complex trade-offs required for climate adaptation, regulatory compliance, and equitable service delivery.

## The work

We are building an ontology that:

- Connects physical assets to the decisions they support
- Represents uncertainty and condition in ways that are useful for planners
- Aligns with existing standards while extending them for emerging challenges
- Supports spatial analysis and scenario modelling

## Collaboration

This work is developed in partnership with water industry practitioners to ensure that the resulting framework is grounded in operational reality.
