Visioning Lab created a 3D model of a neighbourhood in Mozilla Hubs to help residents explore future housing developments and discuss change in their area.

## The challenge

Communicating proposed housing developments through plans and renders can be abstract and intimidating for residents who will be most affected by changes to their neighbourhood.

## The approach

A navigable 3D model of the area allowed residents to explore proposed developments from different perspectives, walk through spaces, and discuss changes in a shared virtual environment.

## Community engagement

The model supported meaningful consultation by making future scenarios tangible and discussable.
