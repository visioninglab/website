Giant Insect World (GIW) is an immersive exhibition that invites visitors to experience the world from an insect's perspective — scaled up to monumental proportions.

## Concept

What if you could stand inside a beehive? Walk through a spider's web? See the world through compound eyes? GIW transforms scientific research about insect behaviour, ecology, and anatomy into spatial experiences that are visceral, educational, and unforgettable.

## Approach

The project combines:

- **Scientific rigour** — All content is grounded in current entomological research
- **Immersive design** — Large-scale physical installations augmented with digital media
- **Narrative structure** — Visitors journey through interconnected environments, each revealing a different aspect of insect life

## Impact

GIW demonstrates that research communication can be experiential. By placing visitors inside the subject matter, we create understanding that goes beyond information transfer — it becomes embodied knowledge.
