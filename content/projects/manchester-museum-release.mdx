Created for the reopening of Manchester Museum's insect gallery, Release allowed visitors to hover a tablet over real butterfly specimens and see them animate and fly on screen. The concept explored the idea of releasing the spirit of insects from museum displays.

## Museum interpretation

Natural history museums preserve specimens, freezing them in time. Release explored what it might mean to give those specimens digital life.

## The experience

Visitors used tablets to scan butterfly specimens in display cases. On screen, the butterflies animated, stretched their wings, and flew — a poetic gesture of digital resurrection.

## Death and preservation

The project asked questions about museums, preservation and the relationship between specimens and the living creatures they once were.
