As scientist-in-residence at Fleetwood Pavilion, Visioning Lab created an exhibition imagining future travellers visiting the town. Stories and artefacts gathered during a six-week engagement programme were turned into an installation celebrating local identity and futures.

## Residency approach

Six weeks of engagement with residents, local historians and community groups explored what makes Fleetwood unique and what futures people hoped for.

## The exhibition

Stories and objects collected during the residency were arranged as if left by future visitors to the town, creating a speculative archive that celebrated local character.

## Community futures

The project demonstrated how participatory methods can support communities in articulating their own visions for the future.
