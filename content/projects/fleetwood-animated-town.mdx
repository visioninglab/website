Visioning Lab worked with Fleetwood's council, producers and venues to explore how digital tools could animate the seaside town. Outputs included a navigable 3D virtual model of Fleetwood, audio trails with local historians and a strategy for future digital cultural trails.

## Context

Fleetwood, a small seaside town in Lancashire, wanted to explore how digital cultural programming could attract visitors and celebrate local heritage.

## Outputs

A 3D model of the town centre provided a virtual space for planning and storytelling. Audio trails featured local historians sharing memories and knowledge. The strategy outlined pathways for future digital commissions.

## Place-based digital

The project demonstrated how smaller towns can use immersive technology and location-based media to tell their own stories.
