With Wordsworth Museum and Grasmere Women's Institute, Visioning Lab created a location-based audio walk using the Echoes app. Visitors walked around Grasmere hearing readings from Dorothy Wordsworth's journal at the locations she described.

## Concept

Dorothy Wordsworth's Grasmere Journal offers intimate observations of place, weather and daily life. The trail allowed visitors to hear her words in the precise locations she wrote about.

## Delivery

Using the Echoes app, audio automatically triggered as visitors reached each location, creating a seamless experience of moving through Dorothy's landscape and words simultaneously.

## Impact

The trail revealed Dorothy's voice and vision, often overshadowed by her brother William, and demonstrated how location-based technology can deepen literary heritage experiences.
