For RHS Tatton Park Flower Show, Visioning Lab created an AR butterfly experience. Visitors used tablets to "wake" sleeping butterflies by hovering over images on a tree installation. The butterflies were drawn in VR by artist Jackie Clarke and animated to appear on screen during the five-day festival.

## Festival installation

A physical tree installation featured images of sleeping butterflies. AR brought them to life when visitors hovered tablets over the tree.

## Artistic collaboration

Artist Jackie Clarke drew butterflies in VR. These drawings became the basis for the animated AR butterflies, preserving the gestural quality of her mark-making.

## Interactive nature

The installation invited gentle interaction — visitors "woke" butterflies by approaching them, creating a moment of connection between physical installation and digital animation.
